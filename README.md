1. Approach jupyter-notebook

http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/

The idea was to solve the problem from the URL above, I 
made a different solution using Python.

The solution comprise the following steps:

- Generate a sequence of items bought
- Count the elements
- Calculate the final price taking into cosideration the promotions listed; the function check_out evaluates the frequencies of items.


2. Using same functions I created a folder containig three files:
- rules.py = containing the prices and offers
- check_out.py = containing all functions to assess prices and evaluate them. Notice that f(x) 5 contains the testing items listed
in the kata includind CDBA requested
- test.py = the file to run the codes

I hope now is ok!
